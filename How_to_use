To use this script, you would need to have Python and the Selenium library installed on your computer.

You can install Selenium by running the following command in your terminal: pip install selenium

You also need to download the Chrome web driver from https://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/chromedriver/downloads 
and have the path to the chrome driver executable in your PATH environment variable.

Once you have these things set up, you can run the script by opening a terminal, navigating to the directory 
where the script is saved, and running the following command: python dataextractor.py

You will also need to replace the website URL, login credentials, and id of the element you want to extract the data 
from with the actual values for the website you want to automate.

You can also include this script in a larger program or schedule it to run at certain times using libraries such as schedule or APScheduler.
